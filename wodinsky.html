		<h2>Jessica Wodinsky</h2>
		<h3>By Aalhad Patankar</h3>

		<p>On a sold-out night, about 1,800 people occupy the seats and aisles of the Royce Hall auditorium.</p>

		<p>The morning before, however, the theater is empty, creating a quiet and unusual serenity. Well, almost empty.</p>

		<p>About 80 feet above the central seating area inside the building&rsquo;s attic, Theater Production Supervisor Jessica Wodinsky makes herself at home, perched behind three large lights angled downward toward the stage. With a few taps on her iPhone app, a burst of vibrant light replaces a single spotlight to illuminate the space below.</p>

		<p>To Wodinsky, this area &ndash; a cluster of wires, switches, lights and scaffolding that make up the hidden infrastructure of the auditorium &ndash; is her stage.</p>

		<p>As the theater production supervisor, Wodinsky is the master electrician and technician for the theater&rsquo;s productions, and has been helping put together shows at the hall for 30 years. Behind each show that forms the heart and soul of Royce Hall, Wodinsky is part of the brain that makes it all work.</p>

		<div class="pull-quote-left">
		&ldquo;The longevity of people like myself (that work here) is a really fun thing,&rdquo; Wodinsky said. &ldquo;We are sort of like a little family, warts and all.&rdquo;

		</div>

		<p>&ldquo;I was never interested in acting &ndash; I liked working with my hands,&rdquo; Wodinsky said. &ldquo;I never found anything else I like better.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Wodinsky said she&rsquo;d been doing theater since she was 13 years old, and found her niche backstage working on a production&rsquo;s technical aspects.</p>
		
		<p>She attended UCLA as an undergraduate student from 1978-1983 and studied theater, but said that aside from attending the occasional show, she never gave Royce Hall a second thought.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t even occur to me that I could come back, or that they had a group of people working backstage,&rdquo; Wodinsky said.</p>

		<p>After freelancing for about a year, Wodinsky came on as part of the technical staff in 1984, the year Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Coming out of college, you think you know everything, but you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Wodinsky said. &ldquo;It was a big eye-opener &ndash; it was a great way to meet people from all over the world.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Wodinsky said that UCLA was an integral part of the Arts Festival portion of the 1984 Olympics, hosting international cultural shows such as the Royal Shakespeare Company and Teatro di Milano.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Now we take it for granted that we see people from all over the world,&rdquo; Wodinsky said. &ldquo;At the time, that didn&rsquo;t happen that often. We felt very special about the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Over the decades, she worked her way up through different positions on the technical staff until she reached her role today as lead electrician. Wodinsky said her job is to do what it takes to make a show work, and MacGyver solutions for all the technical problems this task requires.</p>

		<div class="pull-quote-right">
		&ldquo;You have to be a little bit of a negotiator, a little bit of a designer,&rdquo; Wodinsky said. &ldquo;And you have to know your equipment, and what will and won&rsquo;t work in this theater. You (have to) know your space.&rdquo;

		<p>&ldquo;You have to be a little bit of a negotiator, a little bit of a designer,&rdquo; Wodinsky said. &ldquo;And you have to know your equipment, and what will and won&rsquo;t work in this theater. You (have to) know your space.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Wodinsky said that to be effective in her position, she has to know a little bit about a whole lot of things, especially the nooks and crannies of the building and its architectural features, some of which date back to the 1920s. Or, as her crew puts it, she&rsquo;s the one who &ldquo;knows where all the dead bodies are buried.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Building architecture, lighting, electric circuitry and crafting gadgets are just some of the components Wodinsky said she works on and has to learn in order to customize the stage for a particular show.</p>

		<p>Stage lighting and other aspects of a performance that can easily be taken for granted, Wodinsky said, can often be complicated by nuances in equipment and design, such as having to convert from European to American power for a highly specialized stage prop.</p>
		<div>
		<p>Although the Internet has made things easier to find, the rapid pace of technology constantly keeps her on her toes, she said as she fidgeted with the dials of her 2-year-old lightboard, which she said she&rsquo;s still trying to figure out.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pedaling as fast as you can,&rdquo; Wodinsky said. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what keeps the job interesting. That&rsquo;s what keeps you here for 30 years.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Another aspect that Wodinsky said keeps her around is the fact that after all these years, the people she works with have become like family.</p>

		<p>Occasionally, the crew meets up outside of the hall for a drink after work, or to support and maybe do some backstage work for a dance recital for a coworker&rsquo;s daughter. Most of their time, however, is devoted to the unpredictable hours spent together in the nooks and crannies of Royce Hall to set up the next big show.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The longevity of people like myself (that work here) is a really fun thing,&rdquo; Wodinsky said. &ldquo;We are sort of like a little family, warts and all.&rdquo;</p>
