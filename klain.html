		<h2>James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Klain</h2>
		<h3>By Aalhad Patankar</h3>
		<div>
		
		<p>Seated next to his son in his cozy Van Nuys home, 93-year-old James &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Klain relaxed into his armchair and pondered for a minute before kicking off the conversation.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to get into my memory bank, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>

		<p>Stored in Klain&rsquo;s memory bank are stories about UCLA stretching back to 1939, when he first stepped into Royce Hall as an undergraduate student, and names such as Ralph Freud, Edwin Pauley and Merce Cunningham, which survive today as buildings and chapters in textbooks.</p>

		<p>As far as the ins and outs of Royce Hall go, you could say Klain wrote the book on it. Titled &ldquo;Royce Hall,&rdquo; the 112-page book published in 1985 chronicles the history of the hall and its significance to the UCLA campus. The book marks the culmination of Klain&rsquo;s 37-year career as the manager of the iconic theater.</p>

		<p>Klain said that as a child, he had no doubts that he would eventually attend UCLA and pursue theater. Growing up in East Los Angeles, all four of Klain&rsquo;s older brothers pursued drama at Lincoln High School and matriculated at UCLA with different majors, such as chemistry and geology.</p>

		<p>When Klain started at UCLA as a freshman in 1939, the university lacked an official drama or theater department and offered no courses in the subject, so he chose to major in English.</p>

		<p>However, Klain remained active in theater and, along with one of his brothers, handled the technical production work for an informal drama program that put on productions at UCLA and toured across different University of California campuses to perform. It was through this channel that Klain first made contact with Royce Hall. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;If you went to UCLA (at the time) and you&rsquo;re going to participate in the theater, you&rsquo;re going to work in a building that has a theater,&rdquo; Klain said. &ldquo;Royce Hall was the only building that had a theater.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The year Klain began college also marked the beginnings of World War II.</p>

		<p>Instead of waiting to be drafted, Klain said he chose to volunteer for the Navy before his senior year as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which aimed to train college students to become Navy officers.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Dad, why did you choose the Navy?&rdquo; his son Daniel Klain interjected.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I heard the food was better,&rdquo; Jimmy Klain responded.</p>

		<p>After serving in the Navy for several years, Klain moved to New York City to pursue his dream of Broadway. Theater and Broadway jobs proved elusive, however, and Klain soon found himself working away from the city in the Catskill Mountains, a popular summer destination for New Yorkers.</p>

		<p>At the Catskills, Klain and a group of several artists and actors found work for a theater promoter who put on shows in the lobbies of the Catskills resort hotels. At first, the arrangement was successful, because the promoter paid rent for the artists&rsquo; apartments and told them they could get food at the hotels if they identified themselves as part of the company.</p>

		<p>Soon, however, the hotels cut off the food supply and the promoter failed to pay the artists or their rent, so Klain was stuck in New York with no food, no money and no house.</p>

		<p>It was then that Freud, the actor whom the Freud Playhouse is named after, called Klain with a proposition. Freud said that UCLA was attempting to put together a formal Theater and Arts Department and needed people to help launch the new program. Freud had heard of Klain due to his undergraduate involvement with drama on campus, and offered Klain a position as the technical director for the new program and the Royce Hall theater.</p>

		<p>Klain said that post-World War II, there was a lot of funding for the development of buildings and programs for the arts, especially on the UCLA campus, which helped spark the early days of theatrical production and public shows in Royce Hall.</p>

		<p>In 1948, Klain joined the staff of the new Theater and Arts Department as a theater technician, and then went on to become the first manager of Royce Hall.</p>

		<p>***</p>

		<p>As the manager of Royce Hall and general UCLA event facilities, Klain said he was responsible for handling all public events, such as commencements, public lectures and performances. He said that through his work in backstage production as a technician, he was used to solving the multitude of problems with the hidden infrastructure that a public show is built upon, such as lighting, equipment, tickets, publicity and &ndash; particularly for Los Angeles &ndash; parking.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Whatever they wanted to bring in, they would say, &lsquo;Jimmy could handle that,&rsquo;&rdquo; Daniel Klain said of his father. &ldquo;Whatever demands were required of that stage, he met them.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Daniel Klain said he loved listening to his father&rsquo;s stories about the eccentric, often bizarre backstage workings that took place behind the curtains.</p>

		<p>One of his favorite stories happened in the '60s, when blues legend Big Mama Thornton was set to perform at Royce Hall.</p>

		<p>The show was about to start, Jimmy Klain said, but Thornton was nowhere in sight. Anxious to begin on time, Klain walked to Thornton&rsquo;s dressing room, where he saw a woman attempting and failing to hand Thornton a large check.</p>

		<p>The woman, a member of the committee hosting the show, was trying to hand Thornton a check of $900 from the UC.</p>

		<p>The check is good &ndash; it&rsquo;s from the state of California, the woman insisted.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Oh no no, you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Thornton, who had risen to success from modest beginnings, often working shows for no pay. &ldquo;Big Mama only works for cash.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>***</p>

		<p>Klain said that two of the most memorable performers for him were American dance choreographer and performer Cunningham and avant-garde musician John Cage, who provided the music for Cunningham&rsquo;s show.</p>

		<p>Klain said he remembers watching Cage tinker for hours on the Royce Hall stage with the prepared piano, placing washers and objects between the piano&rsquo;s strings, a style that he pioneered.</p>

		<p>Klain said he worked intimately with the performers to ensure that their artistic vision, which was relatively new and experimental at the time, would translate well on stage.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They were all kids,&rdquo; Klain said.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re famous now, dad!&rdquo; Daniel Klain said.</p>

		<p>Some people Jimmy Klain encountered through his career didn&rsquo;t gain their fame until after their time at Royce.</p>
		
		<p>In 1973, Jimmy Klain, Daniel Klain and their family were huddled around, watching the 45th Academy Awards.</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;The big movie was &lsquo;The Godfather,&rsquo; and Francis Ford Coppola gets the award for best picture,&rdquo; Daniel Klain said. &ldquo;All Jimmy can say is: &lsquo;He was a terrible usher.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
		
		
		<p>&ldquo;We said, &lsquo;Who cares, he made an incredible movie!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but he was a terrible usher, I had to fire him.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Looking back, Klain said the shows that came into Royce and the kinds of shows that became popular always surprised him. When asked why he chose to write the book on Royce Hall, he took another moment to ponder before he responded.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Do you need a reason?&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<p>Klain said that most of all, the book served as a way to document the events that captivated him for years.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Somebody had convinced me that the things we did were culturally important to Southern California development, and we had to record it so we don&rsquo;t lose it,&rdquo; Klain said. &ldquo;I think I was impressed by that argument, and it was important work.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>At age 93, Klain has been a lifelong Bruin in many capacities &ndash; as a historian, author, stage manager and UCLA football fan since the 1930s. And to his son, Klain has been the chief storyteller of UCLA. </p>

		<p>&quot;My dad is an incredible storyteller &ndash; I loved listening to his stories,&quot; Daniel Klain said. &quot;I grew up with them, so I grew up at Royce Hall.&quot;</p>
